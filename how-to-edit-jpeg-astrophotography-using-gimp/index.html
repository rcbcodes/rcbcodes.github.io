                <p class="text-spacing-25px text-font">One of the biggest parts of astrophotography is editing your photos. This
                    tutoriol will show you how to edit your jpeg astrophotography photos using the free software gimp.</p>
                <img class="image-size-95 image-center mb-20px" src="images/stacked_image.jpg" alt="Unedited picture of the stars">
                <img class="image-size-95 image-center" src="images/stacked_image_finished.jpg" alt="Edited picture of the stars">
                <p class="text-center mb-50px text-font text-spacing-25px">Above are both the unedited and edited images</p>
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">Unedited jpeg images look good, but simply not as good as edited pictures </p>
                <h1>Step one: Removing the problems</h1>
                <img class="image-size-95 image-center" src="images/stacked_image_problems.jpg" alt="The picture of the stars, showing the problems">
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">In the image above the red lines show two problems with my picture. You may not
                    think it's a big deal, but after editing they become more obvious if not dealt with. I believe the problems in this
                    photo are amp glow but I will just be calling them problems. Also, this is just one way of removing the problems,
                    another way, which I mostly do now, is using dark frames (I won't be going over dark frames) when stacking then
                    cropping off whatever is still there. Not everyone's pictures have problems like this, if so Skip to step 2 </p>
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">The first thing to do is select one of the problems using the free select tool as
                    shown in the picture below. Then click "select" (on the top bar) and in the drop down menu click feather. You will
                    need to feather your select according to how big your problem is, I usually feather around 300 for this part</p>
                <img class="image-size-95 image-center" src="images/stacked_image_1_free_select_tool.jpg" alt="The picture of the stars, selecting one problem">
                <P class="text-font text-spacing-25px">Next, in order to remove the first problem your going to need to click "Colors"
                    (on the top bar). In the drop down menu click on "Curves". Near the top of the curves window where it says "channel"
                    (it should currently be set to "value") click on it and change it to the red channel. Click on the bottem of the red
                    line and either drag it down a little, or click on the small arrow facing upwards where it says "imput".</P>
                <img class="image-size-50 image-center" src="images/stacked_image_2.jpg" alt="The red channel curves">
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">Put the red line down until some of the problem matches the rest of the picture
                    as seen in the image below</p>
                <img class="image-size-95 image-center" src="images/stacked_image_3.jpg" alt="The picture of the stars with some of the red in the problem gone">
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">Now zoom in on the problem, reselect a smaller area where the pink mostly is, and
                    feather (I generally feather around 150 for this part). Then use the curves to make the problem match the rest of
                    the picture in the sense of blue and red. the problem might still be too bright.</p>
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">If the problem is too bright, simply click on "Colors" and click on
                    "Brightness-Contrast" in the drop down menu and adjust the brightness to match the rest of the picture the best
                    possible. Then you can unselect by pressing shift + ctr + A</p>
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">Repeat the process with all of the problems</p>
                <img class="image-size-95 image-center" src="images/stacked_image_problems_removed.jpg" alt="The picture of the stars with all the problems fixed">
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px text-center">The picture with all the problems fixed</p>
                <h1>Step two: The editing</h1>
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px"><strong>The first</strong> thing to do in this step is removing some red from
                    the picture, (this part is optinal) click on "Colors" then "Curves" and then switch to the red channel, increase
                    the imput on the bottem of the red line until the picture doesn't have a red tint.</p>
                <img class="image-size-95 image-center" src="images/stacked_image_8.jpg" alt="The picture of the stars with some red removed">
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px"><strong>The second</strong> thing to do in this step is using the "Levels" to
                    make the picture darker and to make the stars stand out more. Click on "Colors" and in the drop down menu click on
                    "Levels". Now in the "imput levels" section use the slide the middle slider right until the picture is as dark as
                    you want it.</p>
                <img class="image-size-95 image-center" src="images/stacked_image_10.jpg" alt="The picture of the stars after editing with the levels">
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">If you didn't make some of the "problems" (referring to the last step) dark
                    enough, then now is a good time to make them a little darker.</p>
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px"><strong>If your photo is of or near the core of the milky way then after all of
                    the problems are fixed I recommend you doing part 5 of this step before parts 2, 3, and 4</strong></p>
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px"><strong>The third</strong> thing to do in this step is to increase the contrast
                    (in "Brightness-Contrast" which is in "Colors"). Basically just increase the contrast until the picture looks the
                    best, Just don't go to far.</p>
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px"><strong>The fourth</strong> thing to do in this step is to even out the
                    brightness. Select (using the "free select tool") any brighter areas in your picture and darken them, using
                    "Brightness-Contrast", until they look the same as the other areas in your image</p>
                <img class="image-size-95 image-center" src="images/stacked_image_12.jpg" alt="The picture of the stars after leveling out the brightness">
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">If there are a lot of trees in your picture you may need to use the "free select
                    tool" to select the trees, then feather around 50-120. Then decrease the saturation by clicking "Colors" then in the
                    drop down menu you can click "Saturation" and then decrease it until the trees look more normal. You just can't
                    decrease the saturation to much, or the sky around the trees will look gray.</p>
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px"><strong>The fifth (optinal)</strong> thing to do in this step, which I would actually recommend you do this after the first part in this step assuming that all the problems are fixed, is to fix the color
                    balance if your picture is of or near the core of the milky way. To do this, click on "Colors" and in the drop down
                    menu click on "Levels" then click on what looks like a color picker with a gray square. (see picture below)</p>
                <img class="image-size-50 image-center" src="images/levels_color_balance.jpg" alt="The color balance using levels">
                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">Now click anywhere on the picture make sure to click a lot of times around the
                    photo to figure out what looks best.</p>
                <img class="image-size-75 image-center" src="images/color_balance.png" alt="After and before with fixing the color balance">
                <h1>Finish</h1>

                <p class="text-font text-spacing-25px">Remember that every photo is different, so experiment with other ideas/tools in
                    gimp as well.</p>
