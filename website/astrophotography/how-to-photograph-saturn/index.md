# How to photograph Saturn

Have you ever hoped to capture the fascinating rings of Saturn?
The first thing I want to say, is that it is possible! You will need a telescope,
but if you have the patience, you won't need any super expensive mount or anything like that.

_Note: These procedures are similar for photographing_  
_planets such as Mars and Jupiter_

This tutorial is going to be showing what I did to create this photo of Saturn with the equipment listed below.

Planetary photography involves finding the planet you're gonna capture. Then taking a video/several videos. Using a proccess called stacking you take the best frames from the video and combine them to reduce noise --- making the image better. And finally, editing the photo to bring out the details.

- [ASI462MC planetary camera](https://agenaastro.com/zwo-asi462mc-2-12-mp-cmos-color-astronomy-camera-with-usb-3-0-asi462mc.html) - other planatery cameras will work as well, even a dslr - though it might not work quite as well

- A laptop computer is also required to save the data onto

- A 2x barlow lens

## Planning

The first thing I would recommend doing is getting a general idea of where Saturn is in the sky at the time you are planning on heading outside. Or at least have a way to figure that out when you are outside.  

My favorite website/program for that is called [Stellarium](https://stellarium-web.org/). Simply search in the search bar for Saturn, and it will show you where it is in the sky. Look for other bright stars around the Planet as well, as a way to find it when you're actually outside (Saturn will have a bit of a yellow tint to it, which should distinguish it from other stars).  

There's also a moble app for Stellarium, which can make this a bit easier, since the app allows you to point your phone in the sky, and it will show you what is what.

Next, you should make sure that you have enough storage on your laptop, as you will be saving the data you capture onto it. Taking raw vidoes uses a lot more storage than you might expect, I would recommed having at least 50 gigabytes of storage.

You should also make sure that you have all the neccesary programs and drivers installed on your laptop. The program I used for actually capturing the data was [Sharpcap](https://www.sharpcap.co.uk/). I recommend testing your camera before heading outside to photograph for the first time.

_Note: Planetary photography is also possible on a dslr_  
_and adapter, similar methods would be used,_  
_ however the results may not be quite as good_

## Finding Saturn

The first thing to do is of course to set up your telescope. Then bring out your computer, eyepieces and barlow lens, and camera.

Something to keep in mind is that your telescope might need some time to acclimate to the tempenture outside, especially if you have an even larger telescope. I haven't ever really had a problem with this, maybe because it takes me some time to find Saturn, and actaully start capturing.  

Next, you should open Sharpcap on your computer, and connect your camera to it. You can do this by plugging it into your computer using the cable provided with the camera. Then click on the "Cameras" button in the top-left of Sharpcap, and choose your camera.  

Also, make sure your exposure is not super low, and set your iso/gain fairly high to make sure Saturn will show up (don't put your exposure so high that the framerate of your camera gets too low)

_Note: if you are using a dslr, then_  
_you won't need to bring a computer outside_

After all that is done, you should find Saturn in the sky, without your telescope first. You can use the app mentioned above.  

The next thing to do, is actually get Saturn in the telescope, with your camera ready to take pictures!

There are a few different approaches to finding Saturn and focusing, here are two methods  

**Method 1:** Insert an eyepiece into your telescope, then find the planet. After you find it, switch to using your 2x barlow lens and make sure it's in either in the center, or if you can see which direction it's moving, you can put Saturn to the opposite side so it stays in view for longer. Now quickly switch the eyepiece out for your camera, and get a rough focus, and make sure it's visible on your computer screen.

That method might be a little tricky and complicated, especially because Saturn is gonna move quickly at that high of magnification, and keeping it visible on your computer can be challenging.

So, since you will probably have to find Saturn multiple times, I'd recommend using the method below unless you are having a hard time finding it, or if you need to get focus if the moon is not out.

**Method 2:** First, insert your 2x barlow lens into your telescope, then your camera. Next use the finderscope on your telescope to find the moon (if it is out). Then focus on the moon. Next head over to Saturn, by only using the finderscope attached to your telescope.

I use the second method, especially if the moon is out, however if it isn't, then you might want to use the first method first, then the second.

All of that might seem like a lot, however, they are just tips and recommendations. Do whatever works for you.

## The capture

Finally! you are almost ready to start capturing Saturn and it's rings!  

First, get the best focus possible by turning the focus knob on your telescope. Spend a little time here and try a few times to make sure you have the best focus posssible.  

Next, in Sharpcap you should set the settings on your camera. Put the exposure low, then turn it up until you start loosing fps. Now change your iso/gain until Saturn is not too bright and not too dark. Be careful to not blow out any parts of the planet.  

The settings I used are below

- Iso/gain: 354

- Exposure: 16.69ms

Now click the "Start Capture" button in the top-left corner of Sharpcap, this should bring up a window before actually starting the video. Move this window off to the side and then place your mouse cursor over the start button, but don't click it.

Figure out which direction Saturn is moving on your computer screen, and position the planet on the opposite side/corner, so that it will stay in frame for the longest amount of time. Now click start!  

Wait until Saturn is almost out of view, then click the "Stop capture" button.  

Now, take a few more videos, using the same proccedures. This way, you will be able to either choose the best video, or combine them get the best final image.

## Pre proccessing

The rest of the proccess will be done inside and on a computer.  

First, either go through your videos and choose the best one. Or combine all the videos. When looking for the best video, look for planet stability - a not shaky planet, and a longer video would be better than a shorter one.  

I combined all the videos in for my image, however that proccess can be kinda complicated, so I'm not gonna go over how to do that in this tutorial.  

Two free programs will be needed for the pre proccessing, they are:  

- [PIPP - Planetary Imaging PreProcessor - to debayer the video, and center the planet in the frame](https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/)

- [Autostakkert - to stack the best frames from the video](https://www.autostakkert.com/)
